# User defined file extensions (Issue #117) TODO List

[x] add option to do straight file output instead of dir/index.extension
[x] outputFileExtension
[x] filter function

[] example of allowing consumers of plugins to override plugin options (e.g. I want a different `outputStyle` in my sass)
[] allow overrides of built-in keys with user extensions (e.g. I want a newer version of liquid)

[] What if multiple plugins operate on the same file extension? SVGO and svgmin, for example
[] Work with non-plaintext file formats like PNG
[] should filter also support String or Array of String and run a configuration method to add globs for ignores?
[] undecided: it’s garbage that I have to use setTemplateFormats too (and there’s not an additive method either), options versus opt-in, you could install the plugin but not want the language
